ABOUT
	PKCS#11 is RSA Security published standard. PKCS#11 is the de-facto standard to access
	cryptographic devices.

	pkcs11-helper is a library that provides simplified interaction with PKCS#11
	providers for user applications.

	pkcs11-helper allows using multiple PKCS#11 providers at the same time, selecting 
	keys by id, label or certificate subject, handling card removal and card insert
	events, handling card re-insert to a different slot, supporting session expiration
	serialization and much more, all using a simple API.

	pkcs11-helper is not designed to manage card content, since object attributes
	are usually vendor specific, and 99% of application need to access
	existing objects in order to perform signature and decryption.
